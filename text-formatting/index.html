    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Jane Yellowrock </strong> series by <em>Faith Hunter</em> is about a Cherokee 
        Indian born during the trail of tears who now can change into 
        the form of a Mountain Lion. The mountain lion, beast, was magically
        bonded to Jane, who lived for decades in the wild before returning
        to her human form.

    <h2>Book 1 - Skinwalker</h2>
    <p>In Skinwalker we get to meet the major players in the series. Jane, her assistant

    </p>
    <p>This quote by Jane sums up her character: <q>Chicken, yeah, that's me. I'd rather fight an old 
        rogue-vamp in my underwear, with my bare hands, than deal with 
        relationship problems.</q></p>
